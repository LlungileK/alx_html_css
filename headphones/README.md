# Headphones - Week 5 HTML & CSS Project

## Welcome!

This is my **HTML and CSS project** for Week 5, named **Holberton School-Headphones**. The aim of this project is to create a fully functional and visually accurate webpage that closely mirrors the design file provided to us.

## Project Overview

The focus of this week's project is on building a webpage **from scratch** using the skills we've acquired so far, including:

- **HTML** for structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **Accessibility** to ensure the site is usable for all users.
- **Responsive Design** to ensure it works well on various devices and screen sizes.

## Objectives

- Recreate the provided design in code.
- Ensure the page is fully responsive, working across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- Maintain a strong emphasis on **accessibility** so that users of all abilities can interact with the webpage seamlessly.
- Apply best practices in HTML and CSS coding, including semantic HTML, clean CSS, and organized structure.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The page will adjust smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Accessible Design**: Accessibility features, such as properly labeled elements and keyboard navigation, are implemented to make the website usable by a wide range of audiences.
- **Modern Styling**: Clean and visually appealing styles using CSS for typography, color schemes, and layout organization.
